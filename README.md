Blockchain technology has been a game changer for transacting, sharing information, and
defining trust in the rapidly evolving digital world. It introduces immutability, decentralised,
enhanced security, and consensus features. It also serves as a digital database or ledger system
that fosters transparency and accountability in business sectors, especially tracking assets. With
the aforementioned, there is undoubtedly potential to be integrated within business enterprises
in a way to promote better security value within business applications. Therefore, you are
commissioned to analyse ONE (1) of the following areas in the healthcare industry:
1) Medical staff credential verification
2) Electronic health records traceability
3) Medical goods supply chain transparency
4) Medical device management
5) Health insurance claims and settlements
In your analysis, you are required to perform the following tasks.
 Part 1: Proposal document
- Review the business use cases above covering the background including the
operations and practices for handling data.
- Propose a solution model thereby the data can be securely stored and chained in a
blockchain manner by leveraging the features of Blockchain.
- As such, you are required to prepare a proposal of a selected business use case
(anyone from the list above) with Blockchain integration.
Deliverables:
Your report should include the following, but not limited to,
1) the selected businessuse case;
2) background information;
3)  importance of the issue;
4)   data analysis;
5)   analysis solution model;
6)benefits;
7) conclusion;
8)  reference.

Part 2: Solution Implementation
Upon the investigation performed above, develop the solution considering the concept
of Blockchain to produce a distributed ledger. This ledger should be replicated across
all the participating nodes in the distributed environment. Thus, each node has a copy
of the ledger storing the digitally signed data. The development of the solution focuseson 
1) a hashing algorithm for the block of data;
2)  a cryptographic algorithm;
3)  digitally signed data;
4)   a block then chained by referencing the block using the previous hash value;
5)   and immutability technique. 
The following diagram
demonstrates the base design of blockchain architecture.

Deliverables:
Your final report should include the following, but not be limited to,
1) the introduction
to the issue and solution development;
2) a refined blockchain solution model, if any;
3)a discussion of the blockchain solution design;
 4) implementation
techniques/algorithms with code snippets including explanation;
 5) conclusion
covering review/evaluation of developed solution;
6) reference.
