Review the business use cases above covering the background including the
operations and practices for handling data.
- Propose a solution model thereby the data can be securely stored and chained in a
blockchain manner by leveraging the features of Blockchain.
- As such, you are required to prepare a proposal of a selected business use case
(anyone from the list above) with Blockchain integration.
Deliverables:
Your report should include the following, but not limited to, 1) the selected business
use case; 2) background information; 3) importance of the issue; 4) data analysis; 5)
analysis solution model; 6) benefits; 7) conclusion; 8) reference.
Sectors:
1) Medical staff credential verification
2) Electronic health records traceability
3) Medical goods supply chain transparency
4) Medical device management
5) Health insurance claims and settlements

Upon the investigation performed above, develop the solution considering the concept
of Blockchain to produce a distributed ledger. This ledger should be replicated across
all the participating nodes in the distributed environment. Thus, each node has a copy
of the ledger storing the digitally signed data. The development of the solution focuses 
on 1) a hashing algorithm for the block of data; 2) a cryptographic algorithm; 3)
digitally signed data; 4) a block then chained by referencing the block using the
previous hash value; and 5) immutability technique. The following diagram
demonstrates the base design of blockchain architecture. 
Deliverables:
Your final report should include the following, but not be limited to, 1) the introduction
to the issue and solution development; 2) a refined blockchain solution model, if any;
3) a discussion of the blockchain solution design; 4) implementation
techniques/algorithms with code snippets including explanation; 5) conclusion
covering review/evaluation of developed solution; 6) reference.
